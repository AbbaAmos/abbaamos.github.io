      <p>Teachers in the US receive less pay compared to the average full-time government employee and have spent more hours on the job than their peers in other economically advanced countries. </p>

      <p>The <a href ="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d21/tables/dt21_322.10.asp"> National Center for Education Statistics</a>, NCES, puts the number of students who graduated from US colleges with bachelor’s degrees in education in 2020 at 85,058 which had fallen from 104,008 graduate teachers in 2011.</p>

      <p>However, teaching is still an attractive field of study for students as it ranks within the top ten courses in the US with the highest number of graduates in the past two decades, according to data <a href = "https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/999001.htm"> obtained</a> from the U.S department of labor and statistics.</p>

      <p>It also makes up about 9.1 percent of the graduates from U.S. colleges within the period studied in the dataset. For this data story, I limited the focus of the dataset to preschool, elementary, middle, special education, and secondary school teachers.</p>

      <iframe title="Number of students graduating from US colleges with bachelors degrees in education since 1970." aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-rEFYX" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rEFYX/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe>

      <p>The consistent decline in the number of qualified teachers may not unconnected to economic incentives or hours worked as US teachers have ranked low on both scales of measure.</p>

      <p>There is no reason given by the Department of Labor for the drop of qualified teachers from colleges in the US.</p>

      <p>Protesting <a href ="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/see-how-the-strikes-and-protests-affected-teacher-salaries/2019/04"> teachers</a> have walked out of classrooms clamoring for higher wages and better working conditions in several US states— Seattle, Oklahoma, and Arizona amongst others.</p>

      <p>In some cases, they have won pay raises but what US teachers receive is small when it's calculated over a working career. The current population of teachers in the US is put at 3.8 million, according to <a href ="https://nces.ed.gov/"> NCES data</a> - which is 2 percent of the US population.</p>

      <p>Looking at the dataset, the average public teacher's annual salary in 2022 was $69,340 with a specialized level of education in relation to the annual pay of a railway switch operator with a high school diploma or its equivalent and two months of training paid $74,400.</p>

      <p>Other government employees that require college degrees make more money than teachers. The annual average earning by an elementary teacher is $5,000 less than the median annual pay of a government human resource worker.</p>

      <iframe title="US teachers earn less compared to other government employees with similar degree requirements." aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Y1DVz" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Y1DVz/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="410" data-external="1"></iframe>

      <p>During the 2022 school year, the average teacher works extra hours, spending around <a href ="https://nces.ed.gov/datalab/powerstats/64-schools-and-staffing-survey-public-and-private-teachers-2011-12/averages-medians-percents"> 50 hours</a> on teaching per week and $300 of their personal money on classroom supplies, the <a href = "https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ntps/"> National Teacher and Principal Survey</a> data shows.</p>
        
      <p>The survey revealed that teacher dissatisfaction in the U.S. <a href = "https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/teacher-job-satisfaction-hits-an-all-time-low/2022/04">appears</a> to be at an all-time high which is due to heavier schedules, especially when compared to their counterparts in other countries.</p>

      <p>A breakdown of how much time (the median number of hours) teachers in the U.S.  spend on specific tasks in class shows that they spend more time in class compared to their counterparts in other parts of the world.</p>
